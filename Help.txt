CREDITS
---------------
Thanks to: ??? for his PopUpMenu-Builder.
This program saved me from a lot of code, 'cause the menus
in this program are activated by API.
Also thanks to: ??? for his Transparent Form-module.
These codes where found on PSC.

I cannot remember (or find) their names, but I thank them anyway.
