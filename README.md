### Description

With this app you can quickly view a directory with pictures (.bmp, .gif, .jpg, .ico, .wmf). All pictures are listed as thumbnails. You can also view a thumbnail in its original size, reduced or enlarged (from 25% till 300%). You can browse in a directory to view all the picture files, no matter how large the directory is. Picture info is also displayed (width, height, file-length,...). On my 650 MHz Pentium II it works very fast - fill the thumbnails in about 1 - 2 seconds. The slowest are the Jpg-files, but it's still OK. This program uses a lot of API-calls, such as API-popupmenus, transparent form, etc...

A helpfile is included and can be called from within the program.
